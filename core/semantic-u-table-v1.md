# Semantic U-Substitution Table (V1.0)

This is the canonical symbolic grammar of **Societas Analysis** — a system for encoding, manipulating, and evolving ideational structures. Each symbol represents a distinct stratal function. All conceptual modeling in Societas must use this table as its foundational logic.

---

## Symbolic Grammar

### κ\[...] — **Kernel Stratum**

The innermost assumption or ontological seed of an idea. What the system *is*, beneath all expression.

> Example: κ\[translatable-morality], κ\[identity-within-systems]

---

### Δc\[...] — **Contradiction Coordinate**

A dynamic site of ontological tension where two or more incompatible strata compete. Treated as a productive signal.

> Example: Δc\[freedom ⊗ security], Δc\[globalism ⊗ tribalism]

---

### Φv\[...] — **Value-Seeking Function**

Defines what the system is trying to preserve, optimize, or reconcile. Guides synthesis and feedback.

> Example: Φv\[coherent translation across agents], Φv\[glocal self-determination]

---

### Λμ\[...] — **Meta-Layer Logic**

Rules about rules. Governs how stratal operations interact, evolve, or conflict.

> Example: Λμ\[ethics-as-runtime], Λμ\[modular-sovereignty stack]

---

### Ξp\[...] — **Primordial Logic Gate**

Root survival imperatives or deeply embedded cognitive functions. Pre-ideological processing layer.

> Example: Ξp\[trust ⊗ coordination heuristics], Ξp\[symbol ⊗ signal parsing]

---

### Σf\[...] — **Fractal Ideology**

Recursive ideational patterns that replicate across scales. Ideological DNA.

> Example: Σf\[nested rule containers], Σf\[moral-lattice-structures]

---

### Ψs(...) — **Synthesis Vector**

A generative operator that resolves contradictions and outputs new U\_x constructs.

> Example: Ψs(globalism ⊗ tribalism) → U\_gnt

---

### Ωτ\[...] — **Temporal Tension Field**

Stratal pressure across time. Tracks decay, legitimacy cycles, or historical force gradients.

> Example: Ωτ\[decolonial memory fields], Ωτ\[trans-generational legitimacy cycles]

---

### πR(...) — **Stratal Resonance**

Measures coherence or dissonance between strata. Used to model alignment, disintegration, or harmonics.

> Example: πR\[state ⊗ substate], πR\[ethics ⊗ enforcement]

---

### θ\[m\:n] — **Stratal Gradient**

Indicates the depth or abstraction level of a stratum. Useful for modeling vertical traversals.

> Example: θ\[1:5] from material to symbolic; θ\[3:6] from heuristic to ideology

---

### χz\[...] — **Dormant Stratum**

Ideas or forces that are latent, repressed, or inactive — but structurally embedded and potentially reactivatable.

> Example: χz\[mythic memory of collapse], χz\[technological messianism]

---

### τ0\[...] — **Arche-Stratum**

Foundational mythos, unprovable axiom, or proto-symbolic substrate. Cannot be reduced further.

> Example: τ0\[divine origin], τ0\[natural right to be]

---

## Additional Syntax Operators

### ⇌codex(...) — **Natural Language Translation**

Human-readable expression of symbolic logic or structure.

### ⊥map(...) — **Contradiction Map**

Visual or tabular representation of stratal conflict.

### ⧉sw(env) — **Swap Simulation Environment**

Used to toggle between `env:sta` (static analysis) and `env:dyn` (dynamic simulation).

### ✳init\[x] — **Initialize Construct**

Declares the beginning of a new symbolic system or U\_x idea.

---

## Simulation Environments

* **env\:sta** — Static modeling: frozen conceptual space, used for categorization, contradiction mapping, and structural logic.
* **env\:dyn** — Dynamic modeling: used for live simulation, synthesis under stress, feedback testing, and time-sequenced ideation.

---

## Usage Protocols

* All Strata Cards must begin with a `U_x` encoding using this grammar.
* Each symbolic structure must include a ⇌codex for human accessibility.
* Contradictions are not errors — they are coordinates.
* No construct is valid without its contradiction and value vector defined.
