## Overview

The **Stratal Compiler Engine (SCE)** is the symbolic runtime mechanism within Societas Analysis that interprets, transforms, and outputs ideational constructs. It treats symbolic inputs as if they were software objects or semantic code, running them through layered interpretation pipelines.

This engine simulates ideation as computation — modeling ideas as executable programs made of stratal symbols.

---

## Conceptual Model

The SCE consists of:

### 🧱 1. **Input Layer** — Symbolic Constructs

Takes `U_x` declarations using formal Societas syntax:

* Input: `U_gnt`, `U_elc`, etc.
* Minimum required components: `κ`, `Δc`, `Φv`

### 🌀 2. **Parsing Layer** — Symbol Stack Decomposition

Each symbol (e.g., `Δc`, `Φv`) is parsed and assigned a role in the computation:

* `κ` → Ontological root node
* `Δc` → Runtime tension logic
* `Φv` → Optimization target
* `Λμ` → Rules of transformation

### 🔁 3. **Execution Layer** — Semantic Runtime

Simulates:

* Contradiction stress testing
* Ideological recursion
* Temporal decay or inheritance (`Ωτ`)
* Nested feedback loops (`Σf`)
* Agent compatibility functions (`πR`)

This layer may run in `env:sta` or `env:dyn` depending on intent:

* `env:sta`: Evaluates and freezes constructs
* `env:dyn`: Evolves or mutates constructs over time

### ⚙️ 4. **Compilation Output** — U\_x Artifact

Final output is:

* A confirmed or updated `U_x` construct
* Possible new contradiction maps
* New Ψs vectors or layered resonance values

## Compiler Rules

| Symbol   | Role in Compiler                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| κ\[...]  | Root memory / ontological constant             |
| Δc\[...] | Conditional runtime trigger                    |
| Φv\[...] | Optimization heuristic / goal constraint       |
| Λμ\[...] | Metaprogram logic handler (if/then/meta rules) |
| Ξp\[...] | Logic gates (primitive evaluations)            |
| Σf\[...] | Recursive control flow structures              |
| Ωτ\[...] | Time-layered state transitions                 |
| πR(...)  | Resonance evaluation between subsystems        |
| Ψs(...)  | Compile-time synthesis operation               |

## Pseudocode Simulation (Conceptual)

```python
U = {
  'κ': 'identity-within-systems',
  'Δc': ('globalism', 'tribalism'),
  'Φv': 'glocal self-determination',
  'Λμ': 'modular-sovereignty stack',
  'Ξp': 'trust ⊗ coordination heuristics'
}

def compile(U):
    contradiction = evaluate(U['Δc'])
    target = U['Φv']
    structure = apply_meta_logic(U['Λμ'])
    result = resolve(contradiction, target, structure)
    return U_x(result)
```

This pseudocode models how a symbolic contradiction might be processed to synthesize a new symbolic construct.

## Use Cases

* **Encoding ideologies as modular software objects**
* **Running nested simulations of belief systems**
* **Automated contradiction synthesis and U\_x generation**
* **Cross-agent semantic compatibility testing via πR**

---

## Future Extensions

* Agent-specific compilers with limited symbol tables
* Meta-compilers that generate other compilers (Λμ loops)
* Stratal compilers for post-symbolic ideation (U\_psl)

---

## Integration

The SCE is the operational backend of every:

* `env:dyn` simulation
* `Ψs(...)` synthesis event
* Multi-agent semantic exchange

It treats every Strata Card as executable symbolic code.

**Societas is not a theory — it is a compiler of structured thought.**
