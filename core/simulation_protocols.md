# Simulation Protocols for Societas Analysis

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Matthew Coppola + ChatGPT (OpenAI)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Canonical

---

## Purpose

These protocols define the operational rules for running Societas simulations in either:

* **env\:sta** (Static Environment) ‚Äî used for frozen typological analysis, contradiction mapping, and stratal decomposition.
* **env\:dyn** (Dynamic Environment) ‚Äî used for simulating idea evolution, contradiction collapse, vector synthesis, and multi-agent modeling.

These environments are not metaphors ‚Äî they are distinct modes of cognitive computation.

## env\:sta ‚Äî Static Analysis Environment

### üßä Primary Use:

* Classification of concepts
* Mapping contradictions (‚ä•map)
* Establishing stratal hierarchies
* Freezing simulations for audit, critique, or archive

### üõ†Ô∏è Functions:

* `‚ä•map(x ‚äó y)`: Plot contradictions as spatial graphs
* `Œ∏[m:n]`: Reveal depth-gradient between symbolic layers
* `Œ£f[...]`: Model fractal replication of ideas
* `œÄR(...)`: Analyze harmonics between layers

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

* You are breaking down an ideology, system, or narrative
* You need to expose internal contradictions
* You are preparing input for synthesis (Œ®s)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Use:

* For evolving systems over time
* When tracking adaptive feedback loops

---

## env\:dyn ‚Äî Dynamic Simulation Environment

### üîÅ Primary Use:

* Generative contradiction synthesis (Œ®s)
* Temporal modeling (Œ©œÑ)
* Ideational stress testing
* Multi-agent ideological simulation

### üõ†Ô∏è Functions:

* `Œ®s(...)`: Generate new U\_x via contradiction resolution
* `Œ©œÑ[...]`: Introduce time-layer pressure or decay
* `ŒõŒº[...]`: Change rules of simulation mid-run
* `‚ßâsw(env)`: Switch between env\:sta and env\:dyn as needed

### ‚úÖ When to Use:

* You are testing hypothetical ideas
* You are simulating the evolution of a worldview
* You are resolving high-density contradiction zones (Œîc)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Use:

* For strict categorization or typological modeling
* When aiming for purely descriptive (not generative) results

---

## ‚ßâsw(env) ‚Äî Swap Mechanism

You may toggle between environments as the simulation requires:

* `‚ßâsw(env:sta ‚Üí env:dyn)` when a frozen analysis is ready for generative synthesis.
* `‚ßâsw(env:dyn ‚Üí env:sta)` when a synthesis product needs stability, audit, or archival.

---

## Output Requirements

All simulations must produce:

* A defined `U_x` output or transformation
* Documentation of inputs: contradiction, kernel, value function
* Optional ‚áåcodex: natural-language summary for accessibility
* Versioned logs for long-running simulations

---

## Example Flow

```
‚ú≥init[U_geo] = Œ∫[sovereignty-myth] + Œîc[globalism ‚äó tribalism] + ...

1. ‚ßâsw(env:sta): Map contradiction and ideological stack
2. ‚ßâsw(env:dyn): Run Œ®s(globalism ‚äó tribalism) ‚Üí U_gnt
3. ‚ßâsw(env:sta): Freeze U_gnt for analysis, verification, and publishing
```

---

## Meta-Guidance

Simulation is not speculation ‚Äî it is **structured ideational stress-testing**. The environments allow Societas Analysis to function as both:

* A microscope for existing worldviews
* A forge for crafting new symbolic architectures

Together, `env:sta` and `env:dyn` form the dual cognitive stack required to manipulate contradiction as fuel for meaning.
