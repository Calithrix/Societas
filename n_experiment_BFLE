# 🌱 Biophoton Feedback Loop Experiment (BFLE)

> A novel, low-cost experiment designed under **Societas Analysis** to test whether **ultra-weak photon emissions** (biophotons) from plants influence growth when reflected back in a closed feedback loop.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **Field**: Biophysics / Bioenergetics / Experimental Botany  
- **Hypothesis**: The morphology and growth behavior of plants will differ under conditions where **biophotons** emitted by the plant are **recirculated** using reflective or filtered materials.  
- **Design Focus**: Low-cost, replicable, citizen-science friendly, with no specialized equipment required.

---

## 🔑 Key Terms

- **Biophoton**: Ultra-weak light emitted by biological organisms (10⁻¹⁶–10⁻¹⁸ W/cm²), typically in the visible to near-UV spectrum. Unlike bioluminescence, these are not visible to the naked eye.
- **Biophoton Feedback Loop**: A hypothetical system in which emitted biophotons are reflected or modulated and returned to the organism, potentially affecting its biological processes.
- **Morphology**: The form and structure of an organism—in this case, leaf shape, stem angle, color, and growth patterns.
- **Mylar**: A highly reflective polyester film used to bounce light. Available cheaply online or in emergency blankets.
- **Phototropism**: The growth response of a plant toward or away from light.

## 🧭 Experimental Design

### 🧬 Group Setup

1. **Control Group**  
   - Plant grows in unaltered box with no mirror lining.

2. **Group A – Visible Light Feedback**  
   - Inner walls lined with Mylar to reflect visible light.
   - Simulates enhanced photonic feedback loop.

3. **Group B – Filtered Feedback**  
   - Mylar-lined with some IR-blocking or UV-filter film applied to sections.
   - Alters spectrum of feedback.

4. **Group C – Directional Feedback (One-Way Mirror Effect)**  
   - Mirrors face inward only, minimizing outside light and maximizing photon return from the plant itself.

### 🌿 Conditions

- All plants should be:
  - Planted at the same time.
  - Watered identically.
  - Kept in the same location, with consistent ambient lighting and temperature.

## 📏 Data Collection

### 📸 Daily

- Take **top-down and side-view photographs**.
- Log date, time, and environmental notes.

### 📐 Weekly

- Measure:
  - **Plant height**
  - **Number of leaves**
  - **Leaf color / hue (subjective or via photo analysis)**
  - **Stem curvature / lean direction (phototropic response)**

### 📊 Optional Quantitative Tools

- Use **ImageJ** or **Fiji** (free image analysis software) to measure:
  - Leaf area
  - Color profile
  - Growth trajectory

- Use Arduino/light sensor logs (if equipped) to cross-validate light exposure.

## 🧠 Analysis

1. **Compare Groups**  
   - Assess if plants in reflective/mirror configurations show:
     - Faster/slower growth
     - Changes in coloration
     - Non-random lean behavior (toward mirrored walls)
     - Leaf curling or changes in leaf size

2. **Behavioral Interpretation**  
   - Do plants behave as if “sensing” their own emissions?
   - Is there an optimal configuration for growth?

3. **Statistical Significance**  
   - Averages and standard deviations for height/leaf count per group.
   - Visual pattern analysis (via heatmaps or time-lapse GIFs if possible).
