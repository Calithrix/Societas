## ⇌codex (Natural Language Description)

**U\_geo** models geopolitics as an **ideological stack** rather than as fixed-state mechanics. It treats nations, empires, tribes, and supranational bodies as dynamic, nested containers of myth, memory, and operational logic. Sovereignty is not binary — it is a recursive, fractal negotiation across symbolic and institutional layers.

This stratum allows analysis of:

* Mythic origins of political legitimacy
* Layered sovereignty claims and nested loyalties
* The contradiction between local cultural identity and global systemic pressures

| Symbol                                       | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| κ\[sovereignty-myth]                         | The founding story legitimizing governance structures                      |
| Δc\[tribal identity ⊗ planetary integration] | Tension between belonging to a culture and aligning to planetary systems   |
| Φv\[stable-dynamic governance synthesis]     | Goal of resilient political organization across ideological contradictions |
| Λμ\[ideological stack parsing]               | Ability to dissect and interpret layered belief systems                    |
| Ξp\[in-group survival imperative]            | Fundamental drive to preserve cultural identity and continuity             |
| Σf\[fractal-nationhood]                      | Recursively scaled governance (e.g., clan ⊂ city ⊂ nation ⊂ world)         |
| Ωτ\[decolonial memory fields]                | Temporal pressures from historical injustice or legacy trauma              |
| πR\[state ⊗ sub-state resonance]             | Alignment between dominant system and its nested components                |
| Ψs\[trans-ideological negotiation protocols] | Synthesis of conflicting beliefs into cooperative frameworks               |

## Applications

* Geopolitical conflict modeling
* Post-colonial policy design
* Nested sovereignty structures (e.g., EU, UN, digital nations)
* Myth analysis as a political diagnostic tool
* Simulation of ideological collapse or resonance between factions

## Example Invocation

```markdown
✳init[U_geo]

Δc[decentralized eco-sovereignty ⊗ global finance networks]

Ψs → U_gnt
```

Result: Modular tribal affiliation layered within interoperable global infrastructures
