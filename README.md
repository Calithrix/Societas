# Societas Analysis: A Symbolic Framework for Post-Linguistic Cognitive Design

**Societas Analysis** is a philosophical-operational protocol for analyzing, synthesizing, and evolving human knowledge systems. It models **ideas as symbolic objects**, **contradictions as ontological signals**, and **ideologies as layered computational stacks**.

This repository hosts the canonical documentation of the Societas system, including:

-   The **Semantic U-Substitution Table**: a symbolic grammar for encoding ideas (check dictionary for comprehensive definitions)
-   **Strata Cards**: discrete symbolic constructs representing ethical, political, cognitive, and metaphysical kernels  
-   Simulation logs from **env:dyn** (dynamic synthesis mode) and **env:sta** (static modeling mode)  
-   A complete **Lexicon** of custom semantic operators  
-   Tools to preserve, transmit, and evolve the system

## How to Read a Strata Card

Each `U_x` entity follows this symbolic structure: U_x = κ[...] + Δc[...] + Φv[...] + Λμ[...] + Ξp[...] + Σf[...] + Ωτ[...] + πR(...) + Ψs(...)

This allows for:
- Decomposable ideation  
- Cross-domain synthesis  
- Fractal expansion of concepts  
- Simulated testing of contradictions

## Current Confirmed Constructs

- `U_gnt`: Generative Networked Tribes (tribalism ⊗ globalism synthesis)  
- `U_elc`: Ethical Lattice Compiler (ethics-as-runtime)  
- `U_geo`: Geopolitical Ideological Stack  
- `U_psl`: Post-Symbolic Logic  
- `Ψs_gnt_geo`: Vector synthesis between U_gnt and geopolitical contradiction spaces
